Only PopulationTransfer_Adiabatic4 and Overall-Measurement4 are up to date! 
Running the matlab programs generates these figures

Overall-Measurement2 
Just assuming off-resonant coupling to a single level, and initial detuning 
set at midway to that level

Overall-Measurement3 and Population_Transfer_Adiabatic3 
Assume off-resonant coupling to all levels, with clebsch gordan
coefficients taken into account (incorrectly for different F's), and the detuning set 
much closer to the nearest level

Overall-Measurement4 has off-resonant coupling to all levels with correct clebsch gordan 
coefficients
